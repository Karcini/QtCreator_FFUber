This folder has no bearing on the application working.  It can be removed if need be.

Folder 'backup copy mydb and travelReceipt' has a "fresh" file for mydb.db and travelReceipts.txt
	


	Note: if for any reason, the fresh files end up with connection errors (which they shouldn't), the final version test files should work.  Just rename them appropriately
		mydb_oldv4_testDatabase.db  		--> 	mydb.db
		travelReceipts_oldv1_testReceipts.txt	-->	travelReceipts.txt

The rest of the files are progress files as I built the project.
	the '.sai2' file is a drawing program where I edited the map
